Here’s a **project name** suggestion along with a **starter GitHub README.md** you can use right away.

---

## **Project Name Ideas**

We want something **catchy**, **simple**, and relevant to mental health and mood tracking. Here are a few options:

1. **MindTrack** – Track your mood and mental wellness. *(Simple, direct, professional)*
2. **MoodMate** – A friendly companion for mood tracking and self-care.
3. **EmotiWell** – Emotional wellness tracker.
4. **SereniTrack** – Serenity + Tracking.
5. **Calmly** – Minimalist and calming vibe.

**Recommended:** `MindTrack` – clean, memorable, and works well for a GitHub repo name like `mindtrack`.

Here's a simple README structure for your project:

```markdown

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mindtrack.git
cd mindtrack
````

---

### 2. Backend Setup (Flask)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mindtrack_db
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

Run database migrations:

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
flask run
```

---

### 3. Frontend Setup (React)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint            | Description                    |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| POST   | `/api/register`     | Register a new user            |
| POST   | `/api/login`        | User login                     |
| POST   | `/api/mood`         | Log a mood entry               |
| GET    | `/api/mood/history` | Retrieve mood history          |
| GET    | `/api/strategy`     | Get coping strategy for a mood |

---

## Example Use Case

1. User signs up and logs in.
2. Logs mood: **"Stressed 😰"** with a note: *"Had a tough meeting."*
3. Backend saves mood and returns a relevant strategy:

   > "Try deep breathing: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8."
4. User sees this tip on the dashboard.
5. Over time, user views a mood chart and sees stress levels peak on weekdays.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Add sentiment analysis for journal entries
* [ ] Integrate external API for guided meditation videos
* [ ] Dark mode for better accessibility
* [ ] Mobile-friendly version

## **Next Step**
- Finalize the project name (`MindTrack` recommended).
- Create a GitHub repository and **commit this README.md** as your first file.
- Then we’ll set up **Flask backend** and connect it to PostgreSQL.  

Would you like me to generate a **backend folder structure with Flask boilerplate code** next?
